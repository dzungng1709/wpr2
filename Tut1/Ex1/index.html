    <h1><b>The History of HTML</b></h1>
    <p>A markup language <b>combines text as well as coded instructions on how to format that text.</b></p>
    <p>Nowadays, if you mention the term <b>markup</b> to any knowledgeable web author, the first thing they are likely to think of is HTML.</p>
    <p>So from whence came the stuff that web pages are made of? ...</p>

    <h2><b>In the Beginning</b></h2>
    <p>HTML — which is short for <b>HyperText Markup Language</b> — is the official language of the <b>World Wide Web</b> and was first conceived in 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee:
       <p>&emsp;&emsp;HTML is a product of SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) which is a complex, technical specification describing markup languages, especially those used in electronic &emsp;&emsp;document exchange, document management, and document publishing.
        
    <p>HTML was originally created to allow those who were not specialized in SGML to publish and exchange scientific and other technical documents.</p>
    <p>HTML especially facilitated this exchange by incorporating the ability to link documents electronically using hyperlinks. Thus the name <b>Hypertext Markup Language.</b></p>
    <p>However, it was quickly realized by those outside of the discipline of scientific documentation that HTML was relatively easy to learn, was self contained and lent itself to a number of other applications.</p>
       <p>&emsp;&emsp;With the evolution of the World Wide Web, HTML began to proliferate and quickly spilled over into the mainstream.</p>
